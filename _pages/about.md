Hi, I am an Applied Data Science Researcher with a focus on text mining. This has everything to do with my background in Artificial Intelligence which I have combined with a study in Linguistics.
From 2011-2015 I was a PhD student working at [TNO](http://www.tno.nl) on a COMMIT-funded project [SWELL](https://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/swell-smart-reasoning-systems-for-well-being-at-work-and-at-home) project. 
My dissertation is titled ['Knowledge Work in Context: User Centered Knowledge Worker Support'](http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/151710) and was aimed at supporting knowledge workers battle their information overload.

After my PhD I have worked at TNO on several research projects related to Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, HCI, Text Classification, Topic Modeling and Information Retrieval.
Moreover, I did a cool project on personalized news summarization at FD Mediagroep.

Currently I am working at [HAN](http://www.han.nl) (University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem/Nijmegen) with the research group Data & Knowledge Engineering. 
I am working on several projects related to data science in general or text mining. We are also developing a master in Applied Data Science. See [projects](./projects) for more info!
