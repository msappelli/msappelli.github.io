### Description
In this project we are creating an overview of the challenges and opportunities of using data in the energy sector.

With the upcoming energy transition there are many challenges in the energy domain on how to distribute
energy efficiently over the grids and how to deal with peak load, maintenance of grids and assets.
Moreover, many data in the energy domain is openly available. This offers opportunities for data science applications.

In this project we are talking to people with different backgrounds to understand the
current situation in the energy domain, possible opportunities for using data, and in which direction
we should focus our efforts.
