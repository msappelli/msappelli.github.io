### Description
The [MMIP Future Factory](https://www.duurzaam-ondernemen.nl/future-factory-een-innovatieve-fabriek-waar-jaarlijks-26-000-duurzame-huizen-gaan-uitrollen/) project is a large project in the Netherlands where we are
working on creating a smart factory for sustainable homes.   

In order to be able to achieve the efficiency and cost effectiveness goals we investigate the possibilities for data-driven approaches in this area.
Among others we are investigating the feasibility of predictive maintenance for heatpumps in private homes.
Optional working of heatpumps and other energy appliances such as PV panels are necessary to achieve energy-neutral goals.


In particular we are working on predictive maintenance of heat pumps, insight in energy performance and user behaviour in households with heatpumps and computer vision technology in order to assess applicability of renovation packages.
