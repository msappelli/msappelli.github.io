At the 2023 ICT.Open we present the results of the ICT with Industry Workshop.
In this workshop I co-hosted a project with Rianne Kaptein from Veiligheid NL on fall risk prediction for elderly.
Together with 3 enthousiastic PhD students we research the possibility to detect fall risk based on EPD information.
