# Innoboot 2022 
## Implementing AI to improve Life! 

- **Date**:  April 19, 2022
- **Registration/coffee:** 13:00
- **Program**: 13:30 - 17:00
- **Networking/drinks & bites:** 17:00 - 18:00
- **Where:** Novio Tech Campus Nijmegen
 

Artificial intelligence is one of the most important driving forces in innovation at this moment, especially in specialised domains. AI is in some cases better than the radiologist or pathologist to diagnose cancer in medical images. Machine learning helps to forecast quality issues in chips manufacturing. And in energy AI helps us save energy by better predictions of the need for heating.

During this event we will discuss how AI is changing the most important economic clusters of the Arnhem-Nijmegen region: Health, High Tech and Energy.

###Program 
In addition to key notes from Marcel van Gerven and Catholijn Jonker, we offer a number of short pitches from both science and business in the plenary session. Followed by two rounds of parallel sessions that will look at the subject from a Health, High Tech and Energy point of view.

**Our Key note speakers are:**
- Marcel van Gerven; Prof. AI & Chair of the department of Artificial Intelligence at Donders Institute
- Catholijn Jonker; Professor of Interactive Intelligence at TU Delft / Faculty EEMCS
  
###Hybrid event
We expect the RIVM guidelines will allow us to host a physical meeting at Novio Tech Campus in Nijmegen with networking, drinks & snacks afterwards. The plenary parts of the event will be streamed online as well. 
 
###Good to know
Presentations are in English & the entrance is free (registration upfront is needed though). We welcome new guests, so please feel free to pass on this invitation to relevant people in your network!

A few days before the event we will send an email from `smb AT radboudumc.nl` with more detailed info on the workshop (you might need to check your spam box).

 We look forward to meet you!
